abstract = {Thanks to a simple SQL extension, Recursive-aggregate-SQL (RaSQL) can express very powerful queries and declarative algorithms, such as classical graph algorithms and data mining algorithms. A novel compiler implementation allows RaSQL to map declarative queries into one basic fixpoint operator supporting aggregates in recursive queries. A fully optimized implementation of this fixpoint operator leads to superior performance, scalability and portability. Thus, our RaSQL system, which extends Spark SQL with the before-mentioned new constructs and implementation techniques, matches and often surpasses the performance of other systems, including Apache Giraph, GraphX and Myria.},
